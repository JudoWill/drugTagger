This Python script makes use of the Whatizit Webservice to tag sentences according to the avbl pipelines at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/webservices/whatizit/info.jsf.
The script reads plain text files from one folder (input) and writes the XML tagged files to (output).
Script modified with kind permission of Dr. Will Dampier (judowill @github)

The Whatizit pipeline can be changed to accommodate specific tagging services that the users may require.
